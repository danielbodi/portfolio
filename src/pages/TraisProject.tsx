                          When I joined Trasis, the team was not used to work with a designer. 
                          This unfamiliarity came from the business, and even the back-end developer in my team.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          They simply didn't have clear design workflows in place.
                          So how could a UI/UX designer fit into their process and bring value?
                          These doubts made it challenging to gain their trust at the start.

                          This required me to make swift, impactful decisions about the design system in Figma and my development approach.

                        <p>
                          To address this challenge, I made sure to be proactive and transparent from the beginning. 
                          I set up follow-up sessions twice a week with my team and the key stakeholders.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In these sessions, I shared updates on what I was working on:

                          <li>The reasons behind my design decisions and how they solved user and technical problems.</li>
                          <li>Wireframes and interactive prototypes to show real progress.</li>

                          These sessions had a significant impact: by seeing real and consistent progress, the business gained confidence in my ability to deliver. 
                          They recognized the quality of my work, my speed of execution enabled by the design system approach, and my problem-solving skills.

                        <p>
                          Being open and transparent, while delivering results quickly, earned their trust and demonstrated my value to the project. 
                          This not only shifted their perspective on working with a designer but also strengthened collaboration across the team. Even during the challenges of COVID-19, when many other projects were cancelled, I remained a key part of the team.

                          Trasis had multiple applications and devices, which made it clear that a reusable and scalable design system was needed for their ecosystem. 
                          As the only designer, I decided to reuse Ant Design's UI kit in Figma as the foundation for the design system. I then built upon this foundation by adding custom components using the Atomic Design methodology to suit the specific needs of their products.

                          Frequent user testing sessions helped me validate the designs and iterate based on feedback. Since the field of radiopharmaceuticals was new to me, these iterations, combined with business input, were very valuable in aligning the UI with user needs.

                          On the development side, I chose to use an NX monorepo with Angular for its ability to manage multiple projects within a shared workspace efficiently. 
                          For CSS, I implemented the ITCSS structure with the BEM methodology, which ensured a scalable and maintainable structure for styling.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          To centralize the design system, I used Storybook as the platform, ensuring that the components were documented and reusable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          However, my contribution to Storybook was limited to a basic stage, as the project budget came to an end.
                          Before leaving, I ensured a smooth transition by handing over and conducting multiple coaching sessions with an internal developer who took over the front-end tasks. These sessions helped with knowledge transfer about the prototypes in Figma, the design system, Storybook setup, and other development practices, ensuring the continuity of the work I started.

                          This project required realistic illustrations of the device's components (like valves, columns, injectors, tubesâ¦), as shown in the example below. These elements were designed to visually represent real parts of the device, allowing users to easily understand and interact with its functions in diagrams and schemas that I also designed to replicate the internal processes of the device, such as fluid channels, reagent movements, and test flows.

                          The QC1 device performs tasks like injecting reagents, flushing channels, rotating components, and scheduling quality control tests. My designs ensured that users could intuitively manage these processes and view their state in the user interface in real-time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The user interface also included features for scheduling QC tests and displaying results in a clear, data-driven format using graphs and tables. This helped users monitor outcomes effectively and make decisions based on precise data.

                        <p>
                          Accessibility was a key focus in the design process. Since users with visual impairments could interact with the interface, I applied UX best practices to make it inclusive. Some of these practices included:
                        </p>
                        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                          <li>Ensuring clear contrasts between text and background to enhance readability.</li>
                          <li>Creating a strong visual hierarchy to guide users' attention effectively.</li>
                          <li>Designing for color blindness by using patterns, textures, or other visual indicators alongside colors.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                          This approach made the UI both visually clear and easy to use, while maintaining the precision and reliability required for a device as complex as the QC1.
