I then built upon this foundation by adding custom components using the <strong>Atomic Design methodology</strong> to suit the specific needs of their products.',

Frequent <strong>user testing sessions</strong> helped me validate the designs and iterate based on feedback. Since the field of <strong>radiopharmaceuticals</strong> was new to me, these iterations, combined with business input, were very valuable in aligning the UI with user needs.',

For CSS, I implemented the <strong>ITCSS structure</strong> with the <strong>BEM methodology</strong>, which ensured a scalable and maintainable structure for styling.',
